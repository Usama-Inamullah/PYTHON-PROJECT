# Performed exploratory data analysis on Zomato restaurant data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook. Cleaned and analyzed data (including ratings) to identify popular restaurant types ('Dining'), common rating distributions (3.5-4.0), typical costs (~300), and differences between online/offline orders based on ratings and volume. Visualized findings using various plots like countplots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to answer specific business questions
#Airbnb Data Analysis ProjectThis project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data (likely NYC, based on neighborhood groups like Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.). The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to pricing, availability, room types, locations, and reviews using Python data analysis libraries.Key Steps & Analysis:Data Loading & Initial Inspection: The dataset (Air bnb Project.csv) is loaded using Pandas. Initial checks include examining columns, data types (.info(), .columns), and viewing the first few rows (.head()).Data Cleaning:Missing values are identified (.isnull().sum()) and handled (e.g., filling reviews per month with 0, filling last review NaNs, dropping rows with missing NAME or host name).Irrelevant or mostly empty columns (license, house_rules) are dropped.Data types are corrected (e.g., last review to datetime, price and service fee cleaned of '$' and converted to float).Duplicate rows are removed (.drop_duplicates()).Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistical summaries (.describe()) are generated to understand numerical feature distributions.Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize key aspects of the data:Price Distribution: Histogram to understand the spread of listing prices.Room Type Distribution: Countplot showing the frequency of different room types (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room).Listing Distribution by Neighbourhood Group: Countplot illustrating where listings are concentrated (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).Price vs. Room Type: Boxplot exploring the relationship between listing prices and the type of room offered.Reviews Over Time: Line plot showing the trend in the number of (last) reviews over the dates available in the dataset.Libraries Used:PandasNumPyMatplotlibSeabornThis notebook provides a clear workflow for cleaning and analyzing Airbnb data, culminating in visualizations that offer insights into the listing landscape.
